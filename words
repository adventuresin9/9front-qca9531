Qualcomm/Atheros QCA9531
MIPS24KEc - big-endian, no fpu
16 TLB

The SoC interrupt controller is a little derpy.

The Mask register doesn't seem to actually mask 
interrupts that come up on the stats register.  So 
the the mask register has to be read and compared 
to what is read from stats.

UART seems to be a regular 8250/16650 compatible.

Unlike the little-endian mt7688, the fpemu seems
to work fine on this chip.

The ethernet is mostly a Tulip 2114x compatible.
